# Twitter favs miner

A simple node script that goes off to Twitter's favourite API and collects them all in `favs.json`.

## Install & Usage

    git clone https://github.com/remy/favs.git
    cd favs
    npm install   # install dependencies
    ./mine.js rem # wait for full download (replace `rem` with your username)
    ./cat.js      # cats out all the tweets

## TODO

* Some useful front end for searching
* Maybe store to a DB instead of a flat file - perhaps to create a service in the future
* Smart extraction of tags and even doc titles by requesting pages linked in tweets
* Make pretty!
